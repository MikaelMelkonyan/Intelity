>An idea of the application - a super simple weather application that shows a list of cities and current weather in them.

## App requirements:
- The application uses https://openweathermap.org/api
- Icons for weather conditions https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions 
- The application caches the most recent weather data and shows it even if there is no Internet connection
- The cities list supports pull-to-refresh and a refresh button on the top panel
- Hardcoded 3 cities: Kyiv, Toronto, London
- If an Internet connection appeared then a warning panel are shown (with weather ‚Äúactual‚Äù time).
