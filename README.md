An idea of the application - a super simple weather application that shows a list of cities and current weather in them.

App requirements:
- The application should use https://openweathermap.org/api
- Icons for weather conditions (the icon is placed left to a city name in the cities list) https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions 
- The application has to cache the most recent weather data and show it even if there is no Internet connection
- The cities list should support pull-to-refresh and a refresh button on the top panel
- Hardcode 3 cities (e.g. Kyiv, Toronto, London)
- If an Internet connection appeared then a warning panel should be shown (with weather “actual” time).
